Canopy Experiment
=================

[James Coglan][1] announced [canopy][2], a

> parser compiler for JavaScript, based on Parsing Expression Grammars
> and heavily influenced by Treetop. 

The defining property of canopy is that it seperates the grammar from
the methods added to the parse tree.

This project documents my experiences with canopy.
